    "A [support vector machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine \"Support Vector Machine\") constructs a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in a high- or infinite-dimensional space, which can be used for classification, regression, or other tasks. \n",
    "Intuitively, a good separation is achieved by the hyperplane that has the largest distance to the nearest training-data points of any class (so-called functional margin), since in general the larger the margin the lower the generalization error of the classifier.\n",
